# Example 10.3: Directory Listing (Program03.cs)

Write a function that writes the absolute paths of all files located in the specified directory and its subdirectories (recursively) to the given text file.

# Example 10.4: Fake Coin (Program04.cs)

Given an array containing the weights of coins. All coins have the same weight except for one fake coin, which weighs less. We have a balance scale available, which can compare the weight of one group of coins against the weight of another group of coins. Write a function that returns the index of the fake coin using the fewest possible weighings. Hint: The number of weighings roughly corresponding to the number of coins is inefficient.
