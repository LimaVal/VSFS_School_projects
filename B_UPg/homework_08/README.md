Write a function that creates a binary file containing a specified number of random positive integers.

## Example 8.2: Conversion of Binary File to Text File (Program02.cs)

Write a function that converts a given binary file containing positive integers into a text file, where each line will contain 10 numbers. Hint: You can determine the number of numbers in the file from its length.

## Example 8.3: Sum of Numbers on Each Line (Program03.cs)

Write a function that, from a given text file containing integers, creates a new text file where each line will contain the sum of the numbers from the corresponding line of the original file. Hint: Use the long data type for the sum.
